        I'm Harris Bunn, an aspiring software developer from Raleigh, NC. I've gained valuable experience through a full stack development bootcamp, and I'm eager to continue growing my skills in the field. I'm looking for an entry-level position where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to real-world projects while further developing my expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
        During my bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of technologies including HTML, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Python. I’ve built dynamic web applications, integrated databases, and worked with both relational and NoSQL systems. This has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end development, and I’m excited to apply this knowledge in creating efficient, user-friendly applications.        </p>
